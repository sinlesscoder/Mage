## Uber Rides System Design

> As a new data engineer at Uber, you are responsible for building the data infrastructure and data models for SQL table for the new Snowflake warehouse in South Africa. To keep things scoped down, imagine that Uber introduces a new vehicle type called a rickshaw. How would you integrate this new vehicle type into an existing relational data schema or maybe even a table?

### Hints:

1. Don't get hung on architecture.
2. Start small and think about SQL tables that you might design.
3. Think about what goes into those tables.
4. Ask a bunch of questions to the interviewer.
5. Ask about business requirements.
